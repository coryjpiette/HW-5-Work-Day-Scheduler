# HW-5-Work-Day-Scheduler
There’s a lot to do and time is short. 

Be sure not to overlook this week’s to-do list by using this user-friendly weekly planner.

When you first open the planner, you will see that the date is always current.

The planner itself allows you to schedule one-hour appointments between 9am and 5pm.

If a time block is gray, that means that the hour has passed and you can no longer schedule appoints for that time.

If a time block is red, that means we are already within that appointment’s time period.

If the time block is green, we haven’t yet reached that hour and you’re good to make an appointment.

Simply click inside the time block and submit you details.

Next, click the floppy disc icon to the right to confirm your appointment. 

You are free to open your dev tools and confirm that the appointment has been recorded in local storage.

If you refresh the page, don’t worry – your appointment is still safe.

Here's an after-hours screenshot of the planner:
